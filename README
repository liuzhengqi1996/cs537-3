This program writes a simple version of the make command, which is called 537make.
It is executed from a command line, reads a a "makefile" and follows the 
dependence specifications in the makefile to determine which commands to execute.

This program is divided into four modules.

The main module include a main function that looks for makefile, parses the file
to build a graph, traverses the graph in a bottom-up order to evaluate the 
specifications and runs each build command.

The parser module include a function that parses lines in the makefile, 
splits valid lines into an array of strings including target, dependence, and 
command, returns array of struct Node.

The graph module includes functions to create node for target and non-target file,
to build a graph that represents the dependences between build specifications, 
to find whether a node has been built, to do post order traversal to execute 
commands for the required node.

The process module includes a function that runs build command in a new process,
waits for its completion, and gets the return code.
